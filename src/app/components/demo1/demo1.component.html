Next, create the input and set the matAutocomplete input to refer to the template reference we assigned to the autocomplete. 
Let's assume you're using the formControl directive from ReactiveFormsModule to track the value of the input.

Note: It is possible to use template-driven forms instead, if you prefer. 
We use reactive forms in this example because it makes subscribing to changes in the input's value easy. For this example, be sure to import ReactiveFormsModule from @angular/forms into your NgModule. If you are unfamiliar with using reactive forms, you can read more about the subject in the Angular documentation.

Now we'll need to link the text input to its panel. We can do this by exporting the autocomplete panel instance into a local template variable (here we called it "auto"),
 and binding that variable to the input's matAutocomplete property.
